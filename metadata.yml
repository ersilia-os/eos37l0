Title: Klebsiella pneumoniae activity prediction
Description: Klebsiella pneumoniae activity prediction based on phenotypic 
  ChEMBL data. Each column corresponds to a specific bioactivity dataset derived
  from ChEMBL, encompassing multiple assays and binarization cut-offs. The 
  global consensus score summarizes the probability of being active. Model 
  developed by Ersilia.
